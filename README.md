# AI Concepts in Unity Game Project

This Unity project demonstrates various game development AI concepts by implementing a simple game scene with an AI-controlled enemy cylinder and a player-controlled capsule character. The game scene features a basic floor with four obstacles placed in the corner regions, and the enemy patrols between nodes positioned around the scene. When the player character comes close to the enemy, the AI-controlled enemy starts chasing the player. The player character can be controlled using the WASD keys in a third-person camera perspective.
